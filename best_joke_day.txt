Four engineers were riding in a car: a mechanical engineer, a chemical engineer, an electrical engineer, and a software engineer. The car breaks down.
The mechanical engineer says "Oh no, sounds like we threw a rod, I think the valves are shot."
The electrical engineer says "I really think it's the points, the spark plugs just aren't firing."
The chemical engineer replied "No I think it's the gas we bought at that last station."
The software engineer told the other three "I have an idea, why don't we close all the windows, get out and then get back in again and see if it starts."


Is it funny?
